# Targeter (Google)

A template-based query builder for performing Google Dorks reconnaissance on a target subject. 

## Use
- Input target FirstName and LastName
- (Optional) Add middle name
- (Optional) Add a keyword to refine your result (i.e. New York OR Lawyer)
- (Optional) Add an exclusion keyword to mitigate noise (i.e. Football). This will not return results featuring this term.
- Construct queries
- You can then choose to run queries individual or all at once.
NOTE: Your browser may block the script by opening multiple tabs when running all queries. You may need to allow this behaviour on the page.
