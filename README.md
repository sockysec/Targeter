# Targeter (Google)

A template-based query builder for performing Google Dorks reconnaissance on a target. 

## Use
- Input target FirstName and LastName.
- (Optional) Add target's middle name.
- (Optional) Add a keyword to refine your results (i.e. New York OR Lawyer).
- (Optional) Add an exclusion keyword to mitigate noise (i.e. Football). This will not return any results featuring this term.
- Construct queries.
- You can then choose to run queries individually or all at once.
NOTE: Your browser may block the script by opening multiple tabs when running all queries. You may need to allow this behavior on the page.
