#Targeter

Targeter is a simple HTML tool for generating and running Google Dork queries. It is designed for use in OSINT Person Searches.

#Installation 
- Download this HTML file
- Open the HTML file in a browser
  
#Use
- Input target name
- (Option) Add a keyword to refine your result (i.e. New York OR Lawyer)
- (Optional) Add an exclusion keyword to mitigate noise (i.e. Football). This will not return results featuring this term.
- Click generate queries
- You can then choose to run individual or all queries.
NOTE: Your browser may block the script by opening multiple tabs when running all queries. You may need to allow this behaviour on the page.
